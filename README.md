# Toasted-Game

Game boy advance game coded in C programming as a final project for CS2261 at Georgia Institute for Technology.

The game was made using C programming with sprites and backgrounds drawn in a program that parses  the jpg,png,bmp files into
usable c files. We used a game boy advanced emulator to display the games. I really enjoyed the creative and open ended
learning that was encouraged in this class.
